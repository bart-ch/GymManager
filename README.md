# Gym Manager - Asp.NET MVC 5 Web Application
The application is designed for employees of fitness club to help them manage their workplace. I introduced all the features in the video on my personal website: https://www.bartoszchodyla.pl/portoflio/gym-manager/. If you want to test the application, it's available at the following address: https://www.gymmanager.bartoszchodyla.pl/.
<h2>Installation</h2>
If you want to run the app on your computer to play with the code, those are the steps you need to follow:<br>
1. Update your local database by typing "update-database" into Package Manager Console (Visual Studio).<br>
2. If you get "A project with an Output Type of Class Library cannot be started directly." error - clean and rebuild the solution.

<h2>Accounts</h2>
By default the database is seeded with 2 different accounts: <br>
<b>1. Normal user/employee account:</b>

<b>2. Admin/Gym Manager account, which has additional privileges such as editing and deleting existing emplopyees.</b> <br>
